    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Pizza is an Italian food that was created in Italy (The Naples area). It
      is made with different toppings. Some of the most common toppings are
      cheese, sausages, pepperoni, vegetables, tomatoes, spices and herbs and
      basil. These toppings are added over a piece of bread covered with sauce.
      The sauce is most often tomato-based, but butter-based sauces are used,
      too. The piece of bread is usually called a "pizza crust". Almost any
      kind of topping can be put over a pizza. The toppings used are different
      in different parts of the world. Pizza comes from Italy from Neapolitan
      cuisine. However, it has become popular in many parts of the world.
